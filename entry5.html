     <p class="pt-sans-narrow-regular">The Alice in Wonderland sculpture by José de Creeft, installed in 1959 near the Conservatory Water in Central Park, is a beloved public artwork that invites interaction from children and adults alike. Inspired by Lewis Carroll’s classic tale, the bronze sculpture features Alice sitting on a giant mushroom surrounded by characters like the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, and the White Rabbit. Commissioned by philanthropist George Delacorte as a tribute to his late wife, the artwork encourages play, with its climbable surfaces making it a favorite spot for families. De Creeft’s whimsical creation captures the wonder of childhood and continues to enchant visitors, blending storytelling with the natural beauty of Central Park.</p>
