     <p class="pt-sans-narrow-regular">The Fearless Girl by Kristen Visbal, installed in 2017, depicts a bronze statue of a young girl standing confidently with her hands on her hips, symbolizing gender equality and female empowerment. Originally placed directly in front of the Charging Bull in Bowling Green, the artwork was commissioned to promote womenâ€™s leadership in business and challenge the traditionally male-dominated financial sector. Though initially intended as a temporary installation, public support led to its relocation near the New York Stock Exchange. Fearless Girl has become an enduring symbol of empowerment, inspiring conversations about gender diversity and equality across industries and beyond.</p>
